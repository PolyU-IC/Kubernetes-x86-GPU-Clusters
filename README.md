# Kubernetes-x86-GPU-Clusters
This repository is a guildeline for setting up a x86 Nvidia GPU Cluster using Kubernetes. A **"Single Master Multi Slaves** topology is implemented and tested with the following hardware specifications.

1. Intel Core i7-4790 CPU@3.6GHz x8
2. GeForce GTX 1650/PCIe/SSE2
3. Memory 15.6 Gib
4. Ubuntu 16.04 LTS 64-bit
5. Storage 516.4 GB

**NVIDIA GTX 1650**
The GeForce 1650 is built with the breakthrough graphics performance of the award-wining NVIDIA Turing architecture. This GPU will be the cornerstone of the deeplearning cluster built by kubernetes.
